						<li>pass background and security checks and give details of any previous convictions</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Each police force has its own recruitment rules, so you’ll need to contact your <a href="https://www.police.uk/contact/force-websites/">local police force</a> to apply.</p>

					<p>Normally, you’ll apply to one police force at a time.</p> 

					<p>If your application is successful, you’ll be invited to an assessment centre where you’ll:</p>

						<li>take a medical and eyesight test</li>
					</ul>

					<p>If you’re unsuccessful, you may have to wait a minimum of 6 months before you can re-apply.</p>

					<p>You could also prepare by applying for a Level 2 or 3 college course in Public Services.</p>

					<p>If you have a 2:1 degree, you could apply for the <a href="https://www.policenow.org.uk/the-programme/apply/are-you-the-right-fit/">Police Now Graduate Leadership Development Programme</a>.</p>

					<p>If you’ve got management experience you could <a href="http://www.leadbeyond.police.uk/">apply for direct entry as an inspector or superintendent</a>.</p>

					<p>You could also get into the job through a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apprenticeships-guide">level 3 apprenticeship in policing</a>.</p>

					<p>To get an idea of what it’s like to be a police officer, you could either:</p>

					<ul class="list list-bullet">
						<li>volunteer as a <a href="http://recruit.college.police.uk/Special">special constable</a></li>
						<li>work as a <a href="http://recruit.college.police.uk/pcso">community support officer</a></li>
					</ul>

					<p>If you’re aged 13 to 18 you could become a <a href="http://www.nationalvpc.org/Become-a-Police-Cadet">police cadet</a>.</p>
