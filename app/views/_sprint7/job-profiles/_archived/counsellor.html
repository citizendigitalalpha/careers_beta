                    <h2 class="heading-large">1. How to become a counsellor</h2>

					<p>To be a fully qualified counsellor, you’ll need:</p>

					<ul class="list list-bullet">
						<li>to do accredited training courses: Introduction to Counselling, Certificate in Counselling and Diploma in Counselling</li>
						<li>enhanced background checks by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) <a href="https://www.gov.uk/disclosure-barring-service-check/overview">if you want to work with people under 18 or with vulnerable adults</a></li>
					</ul> 

					<p>You can do accredited courses at local colleges and training centres.</p>

					<p>Although you don’t have to be a member of a professional body, working towards membership can improve your chances of getting a job.</p> 

					<p>The professional bodies are:</p>

					<ul class="list list-bullet">
						<li><a href="http://www.bacp.co.uk/join_bacp/">British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP)</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/join/">UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP)</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://www.nationalcounsellingsociety.org/become-a-member/">The National Counselling Society (NCS)</a></li>
					</ul>

					<p>To become a member, you may need to do either:</p>

					<ul class="list list-bullet">
						<li>further study, like a degree or a master’s in psychotherapy or counselling studies</li>
						<li>placement work</li>
					</ul>

					<p>A degree usually takes 3 years and universities accept students with a range of qualifications, or equivalent work or life experience.</p>

					<p>A master’s takes up to 2 years, depending on whether you study full or part time.</p>

					<p>There are many organisations offering work placements, like <a href="https://www.relate.org.uk/about-us/work-us/train-be-counsellor">Relate</a> and <a href="http://www.cruse.org.uk/volunteer/placements">Cruse</a>.</p>

					<p>For professional accreditation you'll have to meet strict rules on training, practice, ethics and length of experience.</p>

					<p>Contact the professional bodies for more information.</p>

					<p>There is help with the cost of courses at:</p>

					<ul class="list list-bullet">
						<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/overview">university</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/further-education-courses/financial-help">college or other training provider</a></li>
