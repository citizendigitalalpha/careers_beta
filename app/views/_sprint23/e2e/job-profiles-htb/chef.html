<section id="what-youll-do">
        <h2 class="heading-large jp-heading">What you'll do</h2>

        <p>You could work in hotels, restaurants, pubs, schools, colleges, cruise ships, the NHS or the armed forces.</p>
        <p>In a small kitchen you may be a general chef. In a large kitchen you may be a specialist chef, in charge of one area like pastry, fish or vegetables, working under a head chef.</p>
        <p>Your day-to-day tasks will vary with your role, but may include:</p>

<section id="career-path-and-progression">
        <h2 class="heading-large jp-heading">Career path and progression</h2>

        <p>With experience, you could progress to section chef (station chef) and look after a particular area like desserts. The next step is sous chef, running an entire kitchen when the head chef is busy.</p>
        <p>As head chef (also known as chef de cuisine), you'll run a kitchen, create menus and manage the budget.</p>
        <p>You could move into the business side by taking a foundation degree or degree in hospitality management.</p>
        <p>Very large establishments have executive chefs, usually in charge of multiple outlets. This is a management role and you would do very little cooking.</p>
        <p>Another option is to train as a teacher or assessor working for a college or training provider.</p>
