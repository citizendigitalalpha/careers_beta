        <ul class="list list-bullet">
            <li>GCSEs at grades 9 to 4 (A* to C) in English, maths and science, plus 2 to 3 A levels <a href="https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels">or equivalent qualifications</a> </li>

        <p>If you have QTS, you can apply for teaching jobs.

        <p>You can get this through:</p>
