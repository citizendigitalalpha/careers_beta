            <p id="answer-1" class="js-hidden">Good answer! Being punctual in the mornings is a key requirement of being a Plumbing Apprentice, and following the advice of your Supervisor is likely to be able to help you to be an effective Plumbing Apprentice.</p>
            <p id="answer-2" class="js-hidden">Ensuring you are prepared by having the map with you is a good idea, but checking the directions as your Supervisor advised you would have ensured you are on time tomorrow morning.</p>
            <p id="answer-3" class="js-hidden">While working independently is good in some situations, taking your own approach rather than following the advice of your Supervisor may not help you to build the trust of your Supervisor. You need to ensure you are punctual and undertake the things that others advice you to do.</p>
