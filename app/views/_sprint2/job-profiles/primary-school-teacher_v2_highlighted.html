                    <h2 class="heading-large">1. How to become</h2>
                    <p>You can take different routes to become a primary school teacher. For all of them you'll need:</p>

					<ul class="list list-bullet">
						<li>GCSEs (grade A* to C) in English, maths and science, or equivalent qualifications</li>
						<li>passes in numeracy and literacy skills tests</li>
						<li>some school experience to support your application</li>
						<li>enhanced background checks by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS)</li>
					</ul>
  
					<p>On each route you’ll work towards qualified teacher status (QTS).</p>
 
					<p>If you’ve got a degree, you can get QTS through a <a href="https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/course-directory/course-search-result?k=primary+school+teacher+&attendance=Class&dfe1619Funded=False&location=&StartDate=Anytime&sort=Distance&distance=5&pageNo=1" class="tools_text-highlight_red">postgraduate teacher training course</a>. You can do this through a school or university. Both routes give you QTS, and the practical skills and knowledge you need for teaching.</p>
						 
					<p>If you don’t have a degree, you can qualify by taking a:</p>

					<ul class="list list-bullet">
						<li>
							<a href="https://digital.ucas.com/search/results?add=&SearchText=BEd&ProviderText=&SubjectText=&AutoSuggestType=&SearchType=searchbarbutton" class="tools_text-highlight_red">Bachelor of Education (BEd) degree</a>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="" class="tools_text-highlight_red">BA (Hons)</a> or <a href="" class="tools_text-highlight_red">BSc (Hons)</a> degree with QTS</a>	
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>To get on to a degree course, you'll normally need at least five GCSEs at grades 9 to 4 (A* to C) and two A levels.</p>

					<p>Some universities may prefer A levels related to national curriculum subjects.</p>

					<p>Universities may also accept equivalent qualifications, like an <a href="https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/course-directory/course-search-result?k=Access+to+Higher+Education+primary+school+teacher&attendance=Class&dfe1619Funded=False&location=&StartDate=Anytime&sort=StartDate&distance=5&pageNo=1" class="tools_text-highlight_red">Access to Higher Education</a> course or a <a href="https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/course-directory/course-search-result?k=Diploma+primary+school+teacher&attendance=Class&dfe1619Funded=False&location=&StartDate=Anytime&sort=Distance&distance=5&pageNo=1" class="tools_text-highlight_red">Level 3 Diploma</a>.</p>
