                    <h2 class="heading-large">1. How to become a TV presenter</h2>
					<p>To become a TV presenter you may not need formal qualifications. Competition for jobs is strong so you will need determination, persistence and the ability to network and promote yourself.</p>

					<p>Some presenters move into TV from other areas of the media like journalism or media research.</p>

					<p>It's important that you build up a network of contacts and understand the way the industry works.</p>

					<p>You could start working in TV in another role like runner to gain experience and build up your network of contacts. Some broadcasters hold competitions to find new presenters.</p>
					 
					<p>You’ll usually need a showreel, featuring clips of yourself on camera to show to broadcasters, producers and agents.</p>
					 
					<p>You may need a science, history or economics degree or detailed knowledge of a subject if you want to work as a presenter for specialist programmes.</p>

					<p>To get onto a degree you’ll usually need at least 5 GCSEs at grades 9 to 4 (A* to C), including maths and English, and 2 A levels.</p>
					 
					<p>UCAS has information on <a href="https://www.ucas.com">degree courses and entry requirements</a>.</p>

					<p>You could gain presenting experience through:</p>

						<li>work placements</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Drama school, acting lessons and short courses in presenting can be helpful for learning some of the skills you’ll need.</p>
