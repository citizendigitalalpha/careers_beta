                    <p>There are no set requirements, but you'll find it useful
                    to have experience in customer service at a supervisory
                    level, and some experience of bar work.</p>
                    <p>Some large pub chains run graduate management trainee
                    schemes that take about a year to complete. You'll usually
                    need relevant work experience and a degree or HND level
                    qualification in an area like:</p>

                        <li>hospitality management with licensed retail</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To become a tenant or leaseholder, you'll need evidence
                    that you have the experience and managerial ability to run
                    a pub successfully. You'll also need to complete the
                    <a href="http://biiab.bii.org/home">BIIAB</a> Level 2 Award
                    for Personal Licence Holders.</p>
                    <p>It's possible for anybody with enough financial backing
                    to buy a pub or bar.</p>
                    <p>As a manager of a pub or bar that sells food, you'll
                    usually need a qualification in food safety. You can find
                    out more from the <a href="http://www.cieh.org/">Chartered
                    Institute of Environmental Health</a> (CIEH).</p>
