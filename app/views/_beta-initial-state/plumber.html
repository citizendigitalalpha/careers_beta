                    <p>
                         To become a plumber, you'll do an industry-recognised
                         qualification eg a Level 3 (NVQ) Diploma in Domestic
                         Plumbing and Heating. The usual way to do this is through
                         an <a href="http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/" rel=
                         "external">apprenticeship</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         You could also take a foundation course in plumbing
                         skills at college. This may help you to find a trainee
                         position with a company. Once working, you can do further
                         training.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         There are short courses in plumbing offering useful
                         background knowledge, but won't qualify you as a plumber.

                    <h2 class="heading-large">6. Working hours, patterns and environment</h2>
                    <p>
                         You'd normally work between 37 and 40 hours a week as an
                         employee. You could work evenings, weekends and public
                         holidays if your firm offers an emergency call-out service.
                         Self-employed plumbers can work longer hours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         You must be able to work in confined spaces and in all
                         weathers. You could also work on scaffolding or from
                         ladders to repair roof guttering or leadwork.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         You'd travel locally between jobs but you may have to
                         work away from home on some contracts.

                    <p>
                         You can develop your skills by taking further training
                         in areas such as heating, ventilation and air-conditioning,
                         and renewable energy technologies like solar powered
                         heating. You can also join the <a href=
                         "http://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/" rel="external">Gas Safe
                         Register</a> or get certified with the <a href=

                         Technical Association</a>. This shows that you're legally
                         qualified to work on gas and oil-fired appliances.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         You could go on to take an HND or degree and become an
                         engineer. This would give you career options in <a href="http://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/job-profiles/building-services-engineer">building
						services engineering</a>, <a href="http://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/job-profiles/estimator">estimating</a> and <a href="https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/job-profiles/construction-contracts-manager">contract
						management</a>.

                    <p>
                         Specialist skills training would also allow you to work
                         in <a href="http://www.the-nhtg.org.uk/" rel=
