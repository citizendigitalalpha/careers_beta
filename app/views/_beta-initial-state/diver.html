                    <h2 class="heading-large">1. Entry requirements</h2>
                    <p>You must pass a medical carried out by a doctor approved
                    by the <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/">Health and Safety
                    Executive</a> (HSE) before you begin professional diver
                    training.<br>
                    <br>
                    You might find it useful to have experience of recreational
                    SCUBA diving before training as a commercial diver, but
                    this isn't essential. Many diving schools offer tests to
                    help you decide whether you'd be suited to working
                    underwater.<br>
                    <br>
                    You don't need academic qualifications to learn diving
                    skills, but to work as a commercial diver you'll need the
                    right skills, experience and qualifications for your
                    industry, like:</p>
                    <ul class="list list-bullet">
                        <li>a degree in surveying or engineering for offshore
                        diving</li>
                        <li>qualifications in welding or non-destructive
                        testing for construction diving</li>
                        <li>a degree in oceanography or marine biology for
                        scientific diving</li>
                        <li>to already be serving in the force for police or
                        armed forces diving</li>

                        pipelines</li>

                    <p>You&rsquo;ll specialise in one type of diving:</p>

                        <li>SCUBA (Self-contained Underwater Breathing
                        Apparatus) - using an air tank and flippers, mainly in

                        <li>Restricted Surface Supplied - using an air line to

                        <li>Surface Supplied - using a hot water suit, air line
                        and open diving bells, in offshore diving</li>
                        <li>Closed Bell or Saturation Diving - using a diving
                        bell and mixed gas for deep sea diving (often used in
                        surveying, marine archaeology and scientific

                    environment</h2>The amount of time spent underwater is
                    strictly controlled, but hours can still be long and
                    intensive.<br>
                    <br>
                    Not all time is spent underwater; time is also spent
                    planning for dives and preparing equipment.<br>
                    <br>
                    Inshore divers work around 10 to 12 hours a day.<br>
                    <br>
                    In some offshore jobs you may have to live for up to 28
                    days in an undersea pressure chamber.<br>
                    <br>
                    Diving is physically and mentally demanding. Conditions
                    underwater are often cold, dark and dirty, especially in
                    inland sites.<br>
                    <br>
                    You'll wear protective clothing and breathing apparatus
                    appropriate to the depth and type of dive.

                    <br>
                    With experience and further training, you could move into
