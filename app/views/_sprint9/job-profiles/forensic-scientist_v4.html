                <section  id="how-to-become">
                    <h2 class="heading-large">1. How to become a forensic science</h2>
					<p>To get into forensic science, you’ll usually need either:</p>
					<ul class="list list-bullet">
						<li>a degree or postgraduate award in forensic science</li>
						<li>a science degree like chemistry, biology, physics, life sciences, applied sciences or medical sciences</li>
						<li>a higher national certificate or diploma (HNC/D) in a science with relevant work experience</li>
					</ul>
					<p>For a degree you’ll need at least 5 GCSEs at grades 9 to 4 (A* to C) and 2 A levels or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels">equivalent level 3 qualifications</a>.</p>

					<p>There’s a lot of competition for posts. A postgraduate qualification or relevant laboratory experience could help you to get in.</p>

					<p>UCAS has information on <a href="https://www.ucas.com">higher education courses and their entry requirements</a>.</p>

					<p>If you want to specialise in electronic casework (recovering data from computers and mobile phones for example), you may need experience and qualifications in computing, electrical engineering, electronics or physics.</p>

					<p>To start as a forensics lab support assistant, you’ll need A levels, a BTEC or an HND in science. You could then study for higher qualifications to become a forensic scientist.</p>

					<p>You’ll also need colour-normal vision.</p>

					<p>You may be able to get financial help to go to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/overview">university</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/further-education-courses/financial-help">college</a>.</p>

					<p>The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences (CSFS) has <a href="http://www.csofs.org">more information about careers in forensic science</a> Not all forensic science degrees teach you the skills and knowledge you need so it’s important to check for accreditation.</p>

				<!--section 2-->
				<section id="skills-required">
					<h2 class="heading-large">2. Skills required</h2>

				</section>

				<!--section 3-->
				<section id="what-youll-do">
					<h2 class="heading-large">3. What you'll do</h2>
					<p>Forensic scientists use a range of techniques to find and study evidence from a variety of sources, like blood and other body fluids, hairs, textile fibres, glass fragments and tyre marks.</p>

					<p>Your main role will be looking for evidence to link a suspect with a crime scene, but you may also specialise.</p>

					<p>Your day-to-day tasks may include:</p>

					<ul class="list list-bullet">
						<li>blood grouping and DNA profiling</li>
						<li>analysing fluid and tissue samples for traces of drugs and poisons</li>
						<li>examining splash patterns and the distribution of particles</li>
						<li>analysing handwriting, signatures, ink and paper</li>
						<li>providing expert advice on explosives, firearms and ballistics</li>
						<li>researching and developing new technologies</li>
						<li>recovering data from computers, mobile phones and other electronic equipment</li>
						<li>attending crime scenes, such as a murder or fire</li>
						<li>giving impartial scientific evidence in court</li>
					</ul>
