                    <p>To become a personal assistant you’ll need to show you’ve got administration skills. You could:</p>
                    <ul class="list list-bullet">
                        <li>study at college for a level 2 or 3 qualification in business administration</li>
                        <li>study at university for a business-related foundation degree, higher national diploma (HND) or degree</li>
                        <li>do an apprenticeship in business administration</li>
                        <li>get work experience and train on the job</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Foreign language qualifications may also be useful if you plan to work in an organisation that deals with overseas visitors and clients.</p>

                    <p>Having extra skills like shorthand and audio typing can also help you get in.</p>

                    <h3 class="heading-medium">College</h3>

                    <p>You could take a recognised qualification in business administration or office skills. Useful courses include:</p>
                    <ul class="list list-bullet">
                        <li>Level 2 Certificate in Business and Administration</li>
                        <li>Level 2 Certificate in Business Support</li>
                        <li>Level 2 Diploma in Business Administration</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Find a <a href="https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/course-directory/home">course in business administration or support</a> near you</p>

                    <p>You may be able to get <a href="https://www.gov.uk/further-education-courses/financial-help">financial help to do a course</a>.</p>

                    <p>Private training providers also offer short, intensive courses.</p>

                    <p>You’ll usually need to be employed in a junior administration role, or be willing to do voluntary work or a work placement.</p>

                    <h3 class="heading-medium">University</h3>

                    <p>To get onto a business-related foundation degree or HND you’ll usually need 2 A levels and at least 2 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels">GCSEs (or equivalent)</a> at grade 4 (C) or above in English and maths.</p>

                    <p>For a degree, you’ll usually need 2 to 3 A levels and 5 GCSEs (or equivalent) at grade 4 or above.</p>

                    <p>UCAS has information on <a href="https://www.ucas.com">degree courses and entry requirements</a>.</p>

                    <p>You can apply for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/student-finance">student finance to cover fees and living costs</a>.</p>

                    <h3 class="heading-medium">Apprenticeship</h3>

                    <p>You could take an <a href="https://www.findapprenticeship.service.gov.uk/apprenticeshipsearch">intermediate or advanced level apprenticeship in business administration</a> before working your way up to a PA position.</p>

                    <p>To get onto an apprenticeship, you’ll usually need GCSEs at grades 9 to 4 (A* to C), including maths and English language. Employers may also accept <a href="https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels">equivalent level 2 qualifications</a>.</p>

                    <h3 class="heading-medium">Work<h3> 

                    <p>You could get a temporary job. This can be a good way of getting administration experience and can often lead to a permanent job.</p>

                    <p>If you’re already working as an administrator or secretary, you could work your way up to a personal assistant role.</p>

                    <p>To get work, you’ll usually need <a href="https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels">GCSEs (or equivalent)</a> at grades 9 to 4 (A* to C) in English and maths.</p>
