    <h2 class="heading-large">How to become a {{profileName}}</h2>
    <p>You'll need a Security Industry Authority (SIA) licence for agency and contractor jobs. To get this, you must:</p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>be aged 18 or over</li>
        <li>pass identity and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/criminal-record-checks-apply-role">enhanced criminal records checks</a></li>
        <li>complete <a href="https://www.sia.homeoffice.gov.uk/Pages/training-qualifications-sg.aspx">approved SIA training</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>An employer will carry out checks on your personal and work history (up to 10 years). You need to let them know about any criminal convictions before you apply for a licence<br> <br>

    You won't need an SIA licence for in-house security jobs at your employer's premises.
    If you work as a contractor on a building site, you'll also need a <a href="https://www.cscs.uk.com/">Construction Skills Certification Scheme card </a> (CSCS) <br> <br>

    Previous experience of working in the police or armed forces could help you get into this job.

    <br><br>
