<!--section 5 -->
<section id="working-hours-patterns-and-environment">
        <h2 class="heading-large">5. Working hours, patterns and environment</h2>

        <p>Your working day may start in the early morning or continue late at night. You may work weekends and public holidays. You could get seasonal work.</p>
        <p>Kitchens are hot, humid and busy and the job is physically demanding.</p>
        <p>You'll usually wear chef whites and a hat.</p>
        <p>You may need a driving licence if you work unsocial hours or in a remote location.</p>

<!--section 6-->
<section id="career-path-and-progression">
        <h2 class="heading-large">6. Career path and progression</h2>

        <p>With experience, you could progress to section chef (station chef) and look after a particular area like desserts. The next step is sous chef, running an entire kitchen when the head chef is busy.</p>
        <p>As head chef (also known as chef de cuisine), you'll run a kitchen, create menus and manage the budget.</p>
        <p>You could move into the business side by taking a foundation degree or degree in hospitality management.</p>
        <p>Very large establishments have executive chefs, usually in charge of multiple outlets. This is a management role and you would do very little cooking.</p>
        <p>Another option is to train as a teacher or assessor working for a college or training provider.</p>
