        <ul class="list list-bullet">
            <li>GCSEs at grades 9 to 4 (A* to C) in English, maths and science, plus 2 to 3 A levels <a href="https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels">or equivalent qualifications</a> </li>

        </ul>
        <h3 class="heading-small">University</h3>
        <p>You can do a Bachelor of Education (BEd) with QTS or a degree in a subject that relates to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum">National Curriculum</a>.</p>

        <p>If you have QTS, you can apply for teaching jobs. If your degree doesn't include QTS, you'll need to do a postgraduate teaching qualification like a <a href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/explore-my-options/teacher-training-routes/pgce">Postgraduate Certificate in Education</a> (PGCE). </p>
        <p>You can get this through:</p>

        <p>Get into Teaching has more information about <a href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/explore-my-options/teacher-training-routes">training routes and funding</a>. </p>
