    <h2 class="heading-large">1. How to become</h2>

    <p>You don't need formal qualifications to become a chef, but GCSEs in English and maths may help.</p>
    <h3 class="heading-jp">College</h3>
    <p>One way into the job is to take a college course, like a Level 2 or 3 Diploma in Professional Cookery. Search for <a href="https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/course-directory/home">courses in professional cookery in your area</a>.</p>
    <p>You may be able to get <a href="https://www.gov.uk/further-education-courses/financial-help">financial help to do a course</a>. </p>
    <h3 class="heading-jp">Work</h3>
    <p>If you don't want to study full time, you could start work as a kitchen assistant or trainee ('commis') chef and work your way up while learning on the job. You could apply for work to local restaurants or catering companies.</p>
    <h3 class="heading-jp">Apprenticeship</h3>
    <p>Another way to learn while you work is to become an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apprenticeships-guide">apprentice chef</a>.</p>
    <h3>Voluntary and work experience</h3>

        <h2 class="heading-large">4. Salary</h2>

        <p>Starter: £13,000 (trainee chef)</p>
        <p>Experienced: £18,000 to £25,000 (section chef)</p>

<!--section 5 -->
<section id="working-hours-patterns-and-environment">
        <h2 class="heading-large">5. Working hours, patterns and environment</h2>

        <p>Your working day may start in the early morning or continue late at night. You may work weekends and public holidays. You could get seasonal work.</p>
        <p>Kitchens are hot, humid and busy and the job is physically demanding.</p>
        <p>You'll usually wear chef whites and a hat.</p>
        <p>You may need a driving licence if you work unsocial hours or in a remote location.</p>

<!--section 6-->
<section id="career-path-and-progression">
        <h2 class="heading-large">6. Career path and progression</h2>

        <p>With experience, you could progress to section chef (station chef) and look after a particular area like desserts. The next step is sous chef, running an entire kitchen when the head chef is busy.</p>
        <p>As head chef (also known as chef de cuisine), you'll run a kitchen, create menus and manage the budget.</p>
        <p>You could move into the business side by taking a foundation degree or degree in hospitality management.</p>
        <p>Very large establishments have executive chefs, usually in charge of multiple outlets. This is a management role and you would do very little cooking.</p>
        <p>Another option is to train as a teacher or assessor working for a college or training provider.</p>
